The primary objective of this project is to create an intricate, multiuser web application using Django framework and Python, which is capable of testing users' knowledge on a specific topic. This robust application would house a database containing at least 20 pre-established questions on the chosen topic. For every new test session initiated, the application will randomly select 5 questions from the database to challenge the user.
Account creation and user management are also fundamental features of the system. Prior to engaging in any quizzes, users must either establish a new account (if they do not have one) or log into their existing account. This implementation provides an effective way to track and record the quiz results for each individual user. The system, consequently, stores the test results in the database, thus allowing users to review their past performances.
The format for each question will comprise four possible answers, of which only one is correct. Upon completion of the five-question quiz, the system will generate a display showing the user's score and a personalized message based on their performance. The user's score percentage (ranging from 0% to 100%) will also be displayed. Performance messages will vary from "Please try again!" for a lower score range (0/5, 1/5, or 2/5) to "You are a genius!" for a perfect score of 5/5.
The system will incorporate an additional feature that allows users who score less than 50% to retake the quiz. Moreover, users will be able to view all their past scores, and the application will display the average score across all quizzes, as well as the highest and lowest scores achieved.
Furthermore, the questions for the quizzes must be selected conscientiously, ensuring they are both relevant and meaningful. These questions must be entirely based on the chosen topic, promoting coherence and consistency throughout the quiz.
